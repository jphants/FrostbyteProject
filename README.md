## Inspiration

## What it does

## How we built it
We used figma for prototyping
We build apk standalone using capacitor so we can wrap the react project
We train a model with ts since python model has some issues with compatibility to export to a bin from a keras
We want to make it standalone since most places woth high anemia rates, may not have internet access so we can't have a server for the queries, since there is no internet
